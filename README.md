## Python Crash Course - Part II (Game project)
Examples and exercises from the book [Python Crash Course, A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming by Eric Matthes](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e)

Note: Each project in Part II of the book will have its own repository, so this repository only covers the Alien Invasion part of the book.

- Chapter 12: A Ship that Fires Bullets (planning, install pygame, draw objects, keyboard events, refactoring)
- Chapter 13: Aliens! (fleet of aliens, moving objects, collision, statistics)
- Chapter 14: Scoting (buttons, mouse events, dynamic stats, displaying info on screen)
